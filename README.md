Game-ify eating healthy!

## Inspiration

Our team has a hard time eating healthy, and we know a lot of other college students do too. In order to try and make this a little easier and more incentivizing, we decided to turn eating healthy into a game to try and give people a little extra push to follow through with healthy eating habits.

## What it does

This project starts each player off with a plant with four leaves. Players are then able to add goals they want to track, such as **Drink 128 oz of water a day** or **Cook dinner 6 times a week**. Players can then track how well they met these goals each day/week, and if they kept all their goals for the week, they gain a leaf on their plant, and if they didn't meet their goals for the week, they lose a leaf. If a player's plant loses all its leaves, **it dies!!** So make sure to try and maintain your healthy eating habits!

## How we built it

We built this website with Node.js and Firebase on the back end and JavaScript on the front end.

## Challenges we ran into

No one on our team has had any previous experience writing websites, so the entire project was a bit of a challenge! Nevertheless, we are very proud that we were able to create a fully functional project in just 24 hours!

## What we learned

We definitely learned a lot about the difference between front end and back end when it comes to developing websites, as well as the whole process of deploying and hosting a website.

## What's next for Growth Spurt

In the future, we'd like to reward players with fruit for keeping their healthy eating streak, allowing them to grow more plants and cultivate an entire garden of healthy eating habits! We'd also like the ability for users to go back and update their goals for previous days in case they were unable to log in a specific day.
